#In this SQL, I am querying a table to quantify data about the use of antibiotics for hospitalized patients - antibiotic analysis focused on bacteria or fungus causing infection and their susceptibility to various antibiotic drug treatments in patients.

#1 How many cases of E. coli were susceptible to ampicillin?
