#In this SQL, I am querying a table to quantify data about the use of antibiotics for hospitalized patients - antibiotic analysis focused on bacteria or fungus causing infection and their susceptibility to various antibiotic drug treatments in patients.

#1 How many cases of E. coli were susceptible to ampicillin?
select count("E.Coli") as Total_Ecoli_Count
from Mass_Sensitivities
where Susceptibilities = "Susceptible" 
	AND Antibiotics = "Ampicillin";
  
#2 How many cases of E. coli were susceptible to cefpodoxime?
select count("E.Coli") as Total_Ecoli_Count
from Mass_Sensitivities
where Susceptibilities = "Susceptible" 
	AND Antibiotics = "Cefpodoxime";
  
#3 How many cases of E. coli were susceptible to ciprofloxacin?
select count("E.Coli") as Total_Ecoli_Count
from Mass_Sensitivities
where Susceptibilities = "Susceptible" 
	AND Antibiotics = "Ciprofloxacin";
  
#4 Total and compare all of the microbes that are susceptible, and identify the antibiotic used and specimen collected.
select Microbes, Antibiotics, Susceptibilities, Specimen,count(Microbes) as Total_Microbe_Count
from Mass_Sensitivities
where Susceptibilities = "Susceptible"
group by "Antibiotics" 
order by "Microbes";
