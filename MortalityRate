#In this SQL, I am querying a database that contains multiple tables that contain information on local causes of death to quantify data on mortality rates per cause of death. 

#1 For Alzheimer's disease, how many local deaths were recorded?
select count("Cause Of Death")
from LocalCausesofDeath
where "Cause Of Death" = "Alzheimer's disease";

#2 For Cancer, how many local deaths were recorded?
select count("Cause Of Death")
from LocalCausesofDeath
where "Cause Of Death" = "Cancer";

#3 What was the most common cause of death locally?
