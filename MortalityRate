#In this SQL, I am querying a database that contains multiple tables that contain information on local causes of death to quantify data on mortality rates per cause of death. 

#1 For Alzheimer's disease, how many local deaths were recorded?
select count("Cause Of Death")
from LocalCausesofDeath
where "Cause Of Death" = "Alzheimer's disease";

#2 For Cancer, how many local deaths were recorded?
select count("Cause Of Death")
from LocalCausesofDeath
where "Cause Of Death" = "Cancer";

#3 What are the totals for each cause of death, starting at the top with the most common cause of death locally?
select "Cause Of Death", count("Cause Of Death") as Cause_of_Death
from LocalCausesofDeath
group by "Cause Of Death"
order by "Cause_of_Death" desc;

#4 How many local deaths were recorded for persons age 25 or less?
select count("Cause Of Death") as Local_Deaths_Under_25
from LocalCausesofDeath
where age <= 25;

#5 How many persons age 25 or less died from one of the top 3 causes of death (diseas of the heart, cancer, or diabetes)?
select count("Cause Of Death") as Total_top_3_causes_of_death
from LocalCausesofDeath
where "Cause Of Death" = "Diseases of Heart" or "Cause Of Death" = "Cancer" or "Cause Of Death" = "Diabetes"
and age <= 25;
