#In this SQL, I am querying a table to quantify data about patient length of stay at three different hospitals, along with associated cost.

#1 What was the shortest stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select min ("Length Of Stay")
from Average_LengthofStay
where Location = "General Hospital";

#2 What was the longest stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select max ("Length Of Stay")
from Average_LengthofStay
where Location = "General Hospital";

#3 What was the average length of stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select round(avg("Length Of Stay"), 0) as "Rounded Average"
from Average_LengthofStay
where Location = "General Hospital";

#4 What was the lowest cost of stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select min ("Cost Of Stay")
from Average_LengthofStay
where location = "General Hospital";

#5 What was the highest cost of stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select max ("Cost Of Stay")
from Average_LengthofStay
where location = "General Hospital";

What was the average cost of stay in the 24 month period for General Hospital?
select round(avg("Cost Of Stay"), 2) as "Average Cost of Stay"
from Average_LengthofStay
where Location = "General Hospital";

#6 What was the average cost of stay in the 24 month period for ALL locations?
select round(avg("Cost Of Stay"), 2) as "Average Cost of Stay"
from Average_LengthofStay;
